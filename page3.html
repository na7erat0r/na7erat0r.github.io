  <h2>Coding</h2>
  <p>Code passion projects, finding creative solutions to problems, and ultimately the satisfaction of creating something out of nothing.</p>
  
  <h2>Hockey</h2>
  <p>As a goalie, hockey creates a team orientated, high pressure, competitive atmosphere, that keeps me wanting to get better and better.</p>
  
  <h2>Games</h2>
  <p>Whether on a board or on a computer, learning new systems, thinking quickly, and again the competition have kept me intrigued with games for years. </p>
